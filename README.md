=====

package tracker chrome extension
for people who buy/sell a lot of things on the internet

[get it at the chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/snailman/gnncgbnoacieamgkmommabmpchlfidca?hl=en&gl=US)

it would be nice if this could pull in the current status of each package, but for now it's just a quick way to centralize links
